# Seekers of the Lost Age Group Concept
## Style of Play
This campaign features island and jungle settings, so I want to emphasize a swashbuckling, Indiana Jones vibe.

**Story-driven Leveling:** I will hand out experience as I see fit to trigger leveling at designated points of my choosing that will be tied to storyline progress.
 
## Group Template
**Group Concept:** A group of strangers is shipwrecked on an island while en route to Sargava.
**Shared History:**  the characters should have little to no shared history
