## Background (Hermit)

Left for dead at birth, Malutir was rescued by an elderly monk, Falren Palidaeu, and taken to the nearby abbey, Brenmieth Sanctum, where he was raised. Following an unfortunate tragedy in which Malutir inadvertently killed a vagabond threatening an abbey priest, the Sanctum Council banished the young half-orc. Outraged at the council's decision, Falren took the half-orc into the wilderness where he continued the half-orc's training in the Dachu Shancho arts until his passing. 
Shortly before/after Falren's death, Malutir made a wondrous discovery while meditating. He achieved an altered state that allowed him to commune with other Dachu Shancho masters. Only abstract images and ideas could be shared, but the general region of the hidden monastery could be discerned.
