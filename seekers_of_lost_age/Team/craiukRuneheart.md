## Background (Noble)

Craiuk was born and raised in the dwarven kingdom of Thranadar in the Mindspin Mountains, where he grew up under a continual state of conflict, primarily with the orc tribes of the Hold of Belkzen. Ancient secrets and lore fascinated him from an early age, and he apprenticed himself to an archaeologist guild where he specialized in infiltrating and exploring ancient sites. He fell under the tutelage of Dagur Dreadbrow, who had a fascination with a legendary ancient serpentfolk empire, particularly its fabled city of Saventh-Yhi.

Craiuk was part of Dagur Dreadbrow's team investigating a ruined fortress, Viperwall, in Varisia. While exploring the ruin they were attacked by a humanoid serpent creature. Only Dagur and Craiuk made it out alive, but they didn't escape empty handed. While Dagur headed to Magnimar to visit the Great Library with his notes, he sent Craiuk on to Cheliax to begin preparations for an expedition into the Mwangi Expanse.

### Campaign Introduction
The plan was to meet on the Jenivere, a ship that Dagur had used in the past and whose captain he trusted. When the Jenivere arrived at Corentyn, Dagur was not aboard. Rather word arrived that he had been slain in Magnimar. Craiuk boarded the Jenivere determined to continue his mentor's mission.
