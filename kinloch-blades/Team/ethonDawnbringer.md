## Background (Acolyte)

Ethon was born in the town, Lastharbor, on the island, Valonde. While he never new his biological father, an elven sailor, his mother married a local city guard three years after his birth. His stepfather was a decent man who taught him the importance of duty and responsibility. Sadly when Ethon was 10, his step-father was slain by street thugs while attempting to stop an assault, leaving his mother had to raise him and his half-sister on her own. Then his mother died of the plague that ravaged Lastharbor two years later.

In the tumultuous weeks that followed, Ethon became separated from his half-sister and then contracted the plague himself. Fortunately an itinerant priest of the Light aided him in recovering. Having no other prospects he left Valonde with the priest to become an acolyte of the Light at one of the major temples on the Everlasting Refuge. 

Ethon had no interest in church politics or cloistered life of meditation and study. He did, however, have a desire aid in expanding civilization and a wanderlust inherited no doubt from his elven father. He also had a strong desire to find his lost half-sister. So at age 26, he earned a commission as an itinerant priest of the church.
