# Lost Mines of Phandelver, Session 1

## Prelude

### Rockseeker Mining

The heroes arrived independently to the small warehouse in Neverwinter bearing the sign, Rockseeker Mining, as instructed to meet Gundren Rockseeker for the job.

- Gundren introduced the heroes to each other, adding "You'll have plenty of time to become acquainted on road."
- he then reviewed the terms of the delivery contract: safe delivery of a wagonload of supplies from Neverwinter to Barthen's Provisions in Phandalin.
	1. all the supplies must arrive in good condition
	2. the wagon and oxen must be in good condition
	3. the heroes will receive their payment of 10gp each from Elmar Barthen upon successful delivery
- Gundren 

At this point, Sildar Hallwinter entered the building with a message for Gundren. The dwarf introduced Sildar before reading the message, becoming extremely excited.

- told Sildar to saddle up the horses, they are leaving immediately. Sildar grabbed the nearby saddlebags etched with the Rockseeker Mining crest etched upon them and headed out
- told the heroes to bring the wagon once its loaded the next tomorrow morning. "The lads, Jonas and Kenan, are out procuring the wagon and oxen as well as some of the supplies."
- gave the heroes a map of area and directions to Phandalin and warned the heroes that the territory could be dangerous, especially off the High Road, and that bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk along the trail

As he dashed out he shouted "There'll be plenty more coin to be earned once you arrive in Phandalin!"

### Getting to Know One Another

Since the group had nothing to do but wait until morning, Lynn invited the others to the Blushing Nymph.

- drinks were had and some stories told

### Heading Out

True to Gundren's word, Jonas, Kenan, and a friend had the wagon loaded and oxen hitched the next morning by the time the heroes arrived at the warehouse. They review the collection of goods with the heroes:

1. 12 sacks of flour
2. 7 casks of salted pork
3. 2 kegs of strong ale
4. shovels, picks, and crowbars (dozen each)
5. five lanterns
6. on small barrel of oil

Craiuk was intensely focused on the wagon invoice, but the others all picked up on a disturbing ill manner about the friend of Jonas and Kenan.

No one is particularly proficient driving a wagon, but Ethon and Craiuk take on the driving assignment. Lynn and Domhnall walk alongside or ride on the wagon intermittently. At the end of each day, the heroes make camp, feed and water the oxen, and set watches. They arrived at the Triboar Trail by the end of the second day.

- on the second day they see a castle upon a large cloud heading southeast.

## Goblin Ambush

At midday the heroes came across the aftermath of an attack on the Triboar Trail.

- Lynn went to investigate, while Craiuk readied his shortbow, Ethon dismounted from the wagon, and Dohmnall cast *mage armor* upon himself
	- Lynn recognizes the Rockseeker Mining Crest on the saddlebags.
- Craiuk and Ethon both notice goblins in the area, but cannot get a warning out in time.

- G3 rushes down to wagon and strike ox-1 for 5hp
