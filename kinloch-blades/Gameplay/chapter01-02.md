### Conclusion

Inspecting the chamber, the heroes find the natural chimney leading up. From the rubbish on the floor beneath the natural chimney, its apparent that creatures above toss trash down here. After some discussion the group decides to explore the main passageway more before attempting any climb up the chimney.

## Main Passage and Steep Passage

While the heroes hold at the steps below the kennels, Craiuk scouts ahead (15 Stealth).

- sees the western steep passage and the overpass bridge, but neither Craiuk nor the Overpass sentry goblin notice each other.
- investigates the western steep passage and doesn't like what he sees (25 Investigation).

Returning back to the others, they decide to follow the main passage. Light is going to become a requirement, but there is nothing to be done for it.

- Craiuk and Ethon will take lead approx 10 ft ahead
- Lynn and then Dohmnall, who will have a light source.

First step is to gather at the first slope of the passageway, which is furthest extent of the dim light.

- group stealth check for overpass sentry succeeds (barely), but no one notices the overpass sentry.
- Craiuk and Ethon sneak further up the passageway, but the overpass sentry notices them and scurries to alert the goblins in at the Twin Pool Cave.
	- scurrying is noticed by the heroes

### Round 1

- TPG3 dashes down the passageway to the first rock dam and starts knocking away the support

- OS fires an arrow at Ethon, missing, before moving back toward the bridge and hiding (12 Stealth)
- TPG1 closes and engages Ethon, hitting with scimitar (3hp), and then disengages
- Dohmnall brandishes the wand with **light** and dashes up the passageway
- Lynn follows, almost reaching Ethon
- TPG4 flees to Klarg's cave to warn the bugbear
- Craiuk moves into the Twin Pools cave to a stalagmite that provides cover, shoots and kills TPG2 before hiding behind the stalagmite (20 Stealth)

### Round 2

- Ethon casts **cure wounds** on himself and tells Lynn about the goblin in the passage (sentry)
- OS readies his bow for one of the party members to entire his firing line.
- TPG1 closes and engages Ethon again, but gets disarmed in the attack.
- Dohmnall enters the cave around the stalagmite and casts **fire bolt** at TPG1 - headshot! (13hp)
- Lynn moves forward to another stalagmite, but cross OS line of fire and gets hit (5hp)
- TPG4 returns and engages Lynn, but misses and then disengages.
- Craiuk badly wounds TPG4 with an arrow (4hp), before moving to east passage corner and hiding (8 Stealth - noticed by OS)

### Round 3

- Ethon engages TPG4 and kills it (3hp)
- OS flees across the overpass bridge

The group decides to deal with who or whatever TPG4 alerted, rather than chase after OS into who knows what kind of ambush.
