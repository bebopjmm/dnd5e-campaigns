# Lost Mines of Phandelver, Session 

Having cleared out the menace of the Cragmaw Hideout and rescued Sildar Hallwinter, the team heads on to Phandalin to complete their delivery. The town is a good 20 miles from their campsite, so they get an early start and arrive by late afternoon.

- Sildar rides in wagon, taking a shift at driving. He's quite chatty and personable and shares some valuable information with the party
	- The three Rockseeker brothers (Gundren, Tharden, and Nundro) recently located an entrance to the long-lost Wave Echo Cave, site of the mines of the Phandelver's Pact. 
	
		> Over 500 years ago, a clan of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelverâ€™s Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power. Human spell casters allied themselves with the dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great forge, known as the Forge of Spells, where magic items could be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin prospered as well. Then disaster struck as orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path.

		> A powerful force of orcs reinforced by evil mercenary wizards attacked Wave Echo Cave to seize its riches and magic treasures. Human wizards fought alongside their dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of Spells, and the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern. Few survived the cave-in and tremors, and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.
	
	- Klarg, the bugbear who leads this goblin band, had orders to waylay Gundren. Sildar heard from the goblins that the Black Spider sent word that the dwarf was to be brought to him. Sildar doesn't know who or what the Black Spider is.
	- Gundren had a map showing the secret location of Wave Echo Cave, but the goblins took it when they captured him.
		- Sildar believes that Klarg sent the map and the dwarf to the chief of the Cragmaws at a place called Cragmaw Castle. He doesn't know where that might be, but he suggests someone in Phandalin might know.
	-	Sildar's contact in Phandalin is a human wizard named Iarno Albrek. The wizard traveled to the town two months ago to establish order there. After the Lords' Alliance received no word from Iarno, Sildar decided to investigate

## Phandalin at Last

As the day is late, Sildar recommends securing lodging first at the Stonehill Inn.
