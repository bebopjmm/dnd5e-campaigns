# Lost Mines of Phandelver, Session 

Having cleared out the menace of the Cragmaw Hideout and rescued Sildar Hallwinter, the team heads on to Phandalin to complete their delivery. The town is a good 20 miles from their campsite, so they get an early start and arrive by late afternoon.

- Sildar rides in wagon, taking a shift at driving. He's quite chatty and personable and shares some valuable information with the party
	- The three Rockseeker brothers (Gundren, Tharden, and Nundro) recently located an entrance to the long-lost Wave Echo Cave, site of the mines of the Phandelver's Pact. 
	
		> Over 500 years ago, a clan of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver’s Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power. Human spell casters allied themselves with the dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great forge, known as the Forge of Spells, where magic items could be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin prospered as well. Then disaster struck as orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path.

		> A powerful force of orcs reinforced by evil mercenary wizards attacked Wave Echo Cave to seize its riches and magic treasures. Human wizards fought alongside their dwarf and gnome allies to defend the Forge of Spells, and the ensuing spell battle destroyed much of the cavern. Few survived the cave-in and tremors, and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost.
	
	- Klarg, the bugbear who leads this goblin band, had orders to waylay Gundren. Sildar heard from the goblins that the Black Mamba sent word that the dwarf was to be brought to him. Sildar doesn't know who or what the Black Mamba is.
	- Gundren had a map showing the secret location of Wave Echo Cave, but the goblins took it when they captured him.
		- Sildar believes that Klarg sent the map and the dwarf to the chief of the Cragmaws at a place called Cragmaw Castle. He doesn't know where that might be, but he suggests someone in Phandalin might know.
	-	Sildar's contact in Phandalin is a human wizard named Iarno Albrek. The wizard traveled to the town two months ago to establish order there. After the Crimson Dawn Legion received no word from Iarno, Sildar decided to investigate

## Phandalin at Last

As the day is late, Sildar recommends securing lodging first at the Stonehill Inn.

- Toblin Stonehill greets the party warmly and informs them he has five rooms available at 5sp a night each
	- Sildar takes one and the players take the rest
- The heroes then take the wagon to Barthen's Provisions to complete the delivery
	- the notice some unsavory looking characters in scarlet cloaks eyeing them as they made their way to Barthen's

### Barthen's Provisions

When the group arrives, Elmar greets them and after taking a quick inventory, tasks his clerks, Under and Thistle, to unload the wagon.	Elmar asks about Gundren, and the party relates the events along Westgulch Trail.

- Elmar is sincerely saddened and distressed to hear the news.
- Elmar mentions that two more Rockseeker brothers, Nundro and Tharden, are camped somewhere outside town. They haven’t been in town in a ten-day and should return “any day now” to resupply
- When asked about business and the town, Elmar tells the heroes that the Redbrands are making it hard on everyone, shaking down local businesses and flouting the town master’s authority.
	⁃	Mentions they frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house

Having satisfied the terms of the delivery contract, Elmar pays the heroes the agreed upon amount of 10gp each.
	
- Elmar buys the gold teeth and jade frog from the heroes

### Stonehill Inn

With the delivery completed, the heroes returned to the Stonehill Inn for a much deserved hot meal and ale. The inn common room had become much more crowded and was abuzz with the news of Gundren. Interacting with the locals, they learn quite a bit about the town:

- Narth, an old farmer: “Sister Garaele, who oversees the Shrine of Luck, recently left town for a few days, then returned wounded and exhausted.”
- Elsa, a gossipy barmaid: “Daran Edermath, the orchard keeper, grows the best apples. You would never guess that he is a former adventurer.”
- Lanar, a miner: “Orc raiders have been seen on the east end of Westgulch Trail. The town master is looking for someone to run them off.”
- Trilena, the innkeeper’s wife: “Thel Dendrar, a local woodcarver, stood up to those Redbrands a ten-day ago when they came by his shop and leered at his wife. The ruffians murdered him. Several townsfolk saw it happen. They grabbed his body, and now his wife, daughter, and son have gone missing.”
- Pip, Toblen’s youngest son: “Qeline Alderleaf’s son, Carp, said he found a secret tunnel in the woods, but Redbrands almost caught him.”
- Freda, a weaver: “The Redbrands hassle every business in town except for the Phandalin Miners’ Exchange. They don’t want trouble with Halia Thornton who runs it.”

The general consensus about the Redbrands is that they are a band of thugs. Everyone misses the old constable who went missing just over a month ago. They are also unhappy that the current townmaster is giving such free reign to the Redbrands under the auspices of providing the town 'protection.'

## Phandalin Day One

The next morning Sildar heads to the townmaster's hall and tells the heroes to swing by in the afternoon. The group first heads over to the Lionshield Coster.

### Lionshield Coster

Linene Greywind greets the heroes. When they inform her of the supplies found back at the Cragmaw Hideout, she is estatic. 

> Between the bandits raiding caravans and the Redbrands 'protection' fees, it's been difficult to make ends meet.

Realizing that time is of the essence, she asks the heroes to escort her workers to retrieve the supplies, leaving tomorrow morning. She is willing to pay the group 50gp for the job.

- the group agrees

Shopping:

- Craiuk trades in his leather armor for studded leather and restocks his quiver

### Shrine of Luck

The heroes proceed to the Shrine of Luck and meet Sister Garaele. Recognizing Domhnall as a fellow member, she is open with the group regarding her concerns about the Redbrands. She asks their assistance with a mission that she has been assigned, and they agree to help.

### Townmaster's Hall

They next proceed to the townmaster's hall, where they see the reward poster. Entering, they first meet the townmaster, Harbin Wester.

- he congratulates the heroes on rescuing Sildar and expresses concern about Gundren
- mentions the reward poster and inquires as too how long the party is likely to stay in town

Sildar interrupts and shows the group into an office he has taken over.

- gives the group the 50 gp that he promised
- glad to hear they are helping out Linene
- also concerned about the Redbrands and Harbin Wester's lax attitude about the issue
- offers 500 gp for locating Cragmaw Castle and defeating or driving off the tribe’s chieftain.
	- Suggests talking to the locals or searching the lands around Triboar Trail for more raiding parties in order to track down the location of the castle

### Down Time

Rest of the afternoon and evening is individual downtime pursuits and preparing to hit the road again in the morning.

## Retrieving the Stolen Supplies

Linene's workers, Landen and Uli, have the wagon, oxen, and pack mules ready by the time the group arrives at the Lionshield Coster. The weather is fair and they make good time, reaching the campsite by mid-afternoon. There is plenty of daylight left, so an initial run is made to the caves. About half the supplies can be gathered and loaded. Upon returning to the campsite, the wagons are loaded, dinner fixed and watches established (4 2-hour watches)

1. Lynn

### Return to Phandalin

The next morning the group sleeps in a bit to give the animals some extra needed rest before returning to Phandalin. Fortunately the return trip proves uneventful and they arrive just after nightfall. Linene is pleased to have the supplies recovered and pays the heroes the agreed upon 50 gp. The heroes head to the Stonehill Inn for a hot meal, drinks, and a nice bed for the night.
