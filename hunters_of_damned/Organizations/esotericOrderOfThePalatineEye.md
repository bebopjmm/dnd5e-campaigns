# Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eye
The Esoteric Order of the Palatine Eyeâ€  (sometimes known as the Eldritch Order of the Palatine Eye) is a very secretive organization thought to be based in Ustalav. The organization works against the Whispering Way.

## Members
Members of the Order delve deeply into political and arcane matters; they are sworn to guard Ustalav and its ancient traditions. One of the main works of the Order is the [Manual of the Order of the Palatine Eye](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Manual_of_the_Order_of_the_Palatine_Eye), which is adorned with the symbol of the Order: a scarab beetle with a single eye image on its back.
