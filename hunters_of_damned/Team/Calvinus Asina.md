| Level | Name | Cast/Range/Comp/Dur | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 0 | eldritch blast | action, 120 ft, V/S, instant | A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1dl0 force damage.|
| 0 | blade ward | action, self, V/S, 1 rd | Until the end of your next turn, you have resistance against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage dealt by weapon attacks. |
| 1 | arms of hadar | action, self, V/S, instant | Tendrils of dark energy erupt from you and batter all creatures within 10 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and can’t take reactions until its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, but suffers no other effect. |
| 1 | dissonant whispers| action, 60 ft, V, instant | You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save. |
| 1 | protect from evil and good | action, touch, VSM, Conc 10min max| one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect. |

### Abilities
- **Observant**: If you can see a creature’s mouth while it is speaking a language you understand, you can interpret what it’s saying by reading its lips.

- **Otherwordly Patron**: The Great Old One
	- Awakened Mind: You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.
- **Eldritch Invocations**
	- **Eldritch Sight**: You can cast *detect magic* at will without expending a spell slot

## Background (Sage - researcher)


### Campaign Introduction
Professor Lorrimor traveled the Inner Sea region lecturing and teaching at universities in locations as far-flung as Manaket and Magnimar, and as different in scope as the bardic colleges of Taldor and the battle colleges of the River Kingdoms. Speaking before standing-room-only lecture halls on topics as widely ranging as military strategy, planar anomalies, theology, and agriculture, Lorrimor's time was highly valued among those ambitious to benefit from his expertise. Despite this, he still managed to provide one-on-one assistance to the most promising of his acolytes. When he saw the potential for greatness in one of his charges, he took it upon himself to nurture their spark. You were such a student. Over the course of several months, you and the late professor spent hours debating the finer points of your topic of interest, and the intellectual doors he opened for you continue to flavor your outlook on the world.
