### Campaign Introduction
Fate smiled on Ihrin and Professor Lorrimor one day in the not so distant past. Through a matter of pure chance, Ihrin was in a position to save the late scholar’s life and did so. His gratitude was effusive, and he promised that he would never forget her. Ihrin was unsure of the nature of the summons in his will, but believed he may have listed her as a possible heir in thanks for saving him from an untimely demise.
