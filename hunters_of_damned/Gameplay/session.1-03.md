# Gameplay Session 1-03
This session starts on the afternoon of Day 3Ludmilla

## Harrowstone Grounds
Ludmilla was very interested in checking out this notorious Harrowstone. 
- Razvan was supportive
- Ihrin liked anything other than researching boring tomes
- Calvinus was hesitant but Kendra encouraged him to join the others ( the household tomes aren't going anywhere)
- Torrin was sure, why not.

### The Vanishing Tracks
As they past the final house along the road leading up the hill to the prison, Ludmilla suddenly heard the jangle of a harness approaching fast. Turning and moving aside, she saw no approaching rider, but tracks appear in the road heading up toward the prison, the size and depth consistent with a wagon. Strangely, when she called out to the others, the tracks were gone. No one else heard the harness jangle.

### The Prison Gates
Ihrin inspected the gates and cautiously stepped through first. Immediately she screamed looked at her arms and legs, and fell to stunned for several minutes. Upon finally regaining her faculties, she explained that she was taken by sudden claustrophobia and that her entire body was on fire. She was still terribly shaken by the ordeal.
- everyone now took the rumors of the prison being cursed more seriously

Assured now that Ihrin was alright, Ludmilla performed the Eyes of the Grave ritual. At its completion, she gasped, and everyone witnessed the sheet of flame surge in front of the prison entry leaving the following inscription on the ground after it disappeared:
> “Come to my world, and be as I; as I am now, soon you will be; embrace your end and witness me.”

As Torrin and Razvan inspected the fiery script, Ihrin and Calvinus ensure Ludmilla was alright. She told them the prison is filled with spirits not at rest, some of them extremely powerful. It was Razvan that first noticed the approaching skeletons.

### Burning Skeletons Encounter
As the skeletons approached, they first appeared to be smouldering, but then they burst into flames.
#### Round 1
- Ihrin took cover behind nearby tree and readied her shortbow
- skeletons dashed towards the party
- Razvan moved and readied his glaive
- Torrin followed (dash)
- Calvinus hurled an eldritch blast, hitting bs3 before falling back
- Ludmilla closed behind Torrin and cast bane, afflicting bs1 and bs4

#### Round 2
- Ihrin fired at bs3, glanced off for no damage
- bs1 closed on Torrin, but the dwarf just barely blocked
- bs2 dashed to close on Ihrin
- bs3 also attacked Torrin but missed
- bs4 closed on Razvan who damaged it badly (oa 11 dmg) before badly wounding Razvan (6hp)
- Razvan pushed back and slew the burning skeleton which promptly exploded but he wasn't injured due to distance
- Torrin missed bs3, but took 3hp from the fiery auras of the skeletons,
- Calvinus hurled another eldritch blast, this time at bs2 (crit) destroying it. Unfort, Ihrin is in blast range but she dodges almost all to the blast (1hp)
- Ludmilla cast sacred flame on bs3, destroying it.

#### Round 3
- Ihrin fell back to stairs
- bs1 attacked Torrin but missed
- Razvan struck bs1
- Torrin destroyed bs1 and too 5 hp from blast, then  kicked in Second Wind (9hp)

### Investiation
Ludmilla cast cure wounds on Razvan. Ihrin was more than ready to get the hell away from this prison, but Razvan isn't. Ludmilla shared that almost all the undead energy lies within the prison. As the group debated staying or going, Calvinus noticed the runes on the prison foundation.
- He identifies them as Varisian, with the name Lyvar Hawkran repeating numerous times. 

As Calvinus studied the runes and made his notes, Razvan kept a watchful eye on the area. Meanwhile, Torrin, Ihrin, and Ludmilla checked out the ruins of the warden's house.
- Torrin warned that the house structure is not safe, but Ihrin paid him no heed
- Just when Ihrin found a letter, part of the building collapsed (5hp). 
	- Torrin pulled her out, but she was badly wounded.
	- Ludmilla cast cure wounds

After Calvinus finished making some notes, the group agreed that they are not prepared to investigate further at this time, and they returned to the Lorrimor Place.

## Back at the Lorrimor Place
The group reviewed what they had learned
- Ludmilla explained again that she sensed a significant undead presence within the prison.
	- 5 powerful malevolent forces stood out
	- there was also a presence that although undead was not malevolent
- Calvinus explained that the runes inscriped on the foundation were very recent
- The letter that Ihrin found was a love letter written in Varisian to Ves signed by Lyvar
- Who is Lyvar Hawkran?
	- Kendra provides the answer: the last warden of Harrowstone, who died along with his wife and many guards during the fire at Harrowstone. 

The discussion turned towards what the group should do next.
- general concern regarding the evil obviously contained within the prison
- who is responsible for the runes on the foundation? the professor?
	- could he it be that he learned of the evil within and was attempting to fight it?
- reviewing the journal indicated that he discovered the strange runes and also reminded the group of the 'cache' in the Restlands
	- Ludmilla stated that she would talk again with the head priest of the temple

## Another Chat with Father Grimburrow
Ludmilla was able to gain an audience with Father Grimburrow. Upon questioning about the supposed 'secret cache', the priest stated that his acolytes had investigated and found no such thing.
- claims yet another delusion of the professor

Ludmilla shared details of her 'scan' of the prison 
- Father Grimburrow stated that the nature of the tragedy at the prison makes the existence of spirits unsurprising (but unable to effectively mask his concern).
- when she hinted that the spirits needed purging, he sighed and grudgingly agreed in principle. He would allow her to proceed as she sees prudent ... for now (i'm not helping you but i'm not stopping you)

## What Next
Everyone agreed that checking out the Restlands for the cache mentioned by the Professor makes sense before another foray at the prison, but that they should wait until tomorrow night.
