# Gameplay Session 1-02

## Day One
Wealday

### The Desecrated Memorial
Torrin and Razvan were up while most everyone else nursed hangovers and went for a run. During the run, they noticed a small crowd gathered at the Harrowstone Memorial. Curious they went over to investigate and witnessed a bloody 'V' on the memorial and blood splatter all around. 

- sheriff acts dismissive, blaming young punks playing some prank.
- Gibs comes out to investigate the fuss. Denies having heard anything last night and blames the strangers
- The situation starts to become heated, but the sheriff puts an end to it

Torrin and Razvan return to Lorrimor Place, where Kendra had some breakfast ready. Ihrin continued to sleep in, and Calvinus, still puking his guts out and sure that he would have to get better in order to die, had no interest in breakfast. The others enjoyed the light repast that Kendra had prepared. Following breakfast, Razvan perused the Professor's journal. Ludmilla hung out with Kendra and Torrin, who caught up and shared more stories about the Professor.

### The Sheriff Returns
A slow knock on the door shortly before noon, revealed Sherrif Caeller, who was following up on the verbal altercation with Gibbs at the monument.

- assures the group he doesn't believe they were responsible, repeating that its probably some prank by local kids.
- expects that they don't go looking for trouble with Gibbs

### Individual Pursuits
- After getting his stomach back under control, but still not ready to eat, Calvinus collaborated with Kendra to research the Whispering Way using the house library.
- Razvan studied the journal more thoroughly
- Ludmilla, Ihrin, and Torrin go check out the local farmer's market that gathers every Wealday to get provisions for Kendra
	- many of the locals are familiar with Torrin and having a cleric of Pharasma with him gets some to open up a bit even if they were suspicious of Ihrin. Inquiring about Harrowstone, they learned a bit in regards to it being haunted

> Now and then, if you visit Harrowstone near sundown, you can hear the ghost of the warden’s wife wailing and sobbing from somewhere within the ruins. She haunts the prison now, forever mourning her husband and attempting to frighten anyone who intrudes on the prison.

### Shared Discoveries
- Razvan didn't discover anything of note
- Kendra and Calvinus shared what they were able to dig up on the Whispering Way (17 Intelligence Arcana).

> Agents of the Whispering Way often seek alliances with undead creatures, or are themselves undead. The Whispering Way’s most notorious member was Tar-Baphon, the Whispering Tyrant, although the society itself has existed much longer than even that mighty necromancer.

### Night Out
After dinner, Torrin and Ihrin decided to pop in at a tavern. The others spent a quiet evening.

## Day 2
Oathday
### Another Chat with Father Grimburrow
Ludmilla was able to gain an audience with Father Grimburrow. Upon questioning about the supposed 'secret cache', the priest stated that his acolytes had investigated and found no such thing.
- claims yet another delusion of the professor
