# Gameplay Session 1-02
This session starts on morning of Day 2
## The Desecrated Memorial
- Torrin and Razvan were up while most everyone else nursed hangovers and went for a run
	- Calvinus puking his guts out until about noon
- During the run, they noticed a small crowd gathered at the Harrowstone Memorial
	- checked out the scene and witnessed the bloody 'V' on the memorial and blood splatter all around
	- sheriff acts dismissive, blaming young punks playing some prank.
	- Gibs comes out to investigate the fuss. Denies having heard anything last night and blames the strangers
		- his shock and outrage seems sincere (insight checks)
	- Razvan investigates (19) and something seems unnatural about the way the blood has bonded to the monument and there are faint tracks
		- (natural 20 Survival) able to follow tracks back to Gibs shack, but fail to find incriminating evidence
	- Gibs accusations intensify and the sheriff steps in to defuse the situation
- Returning to Lorrimor Place, they shared what learned
	- Razvan is convinced Gibs is guilty, Torrin not so sure
	- Ihrin is up for checking out the shack again at night and begins prepping her gear
		- she also heads out to the memorial and scopes out the shack

## Individual Pursuits
- Razvan peruses the Professor's journal for most of the rest of the day
- After getting his stomach back under control, Calvinus collaborates with Kendra to research the Whispering Way using the house library
	- (17 Int Arcana) no additional clues found
- Emani and Torrin go check out the local farmer's market that gathers every Wealday
	- the locals are pretty aloof to Torrin, but as a cleric of Pharasma, Emani gets some to open up a bit. Inquiring about Harrowstone, she learns: Now and then, if you visit Harrowstone near sundown, you can hear the ghost of the wardenâ€™s wife wailing and sobbing from somewhere within the ruins. She haunts the prison now, forever mourning her husband and attempting to frighten anyone who intrudes on the prison.
- Everyone rests up prior to the night investigation

## Investigating the Shack
- Ihrin takes the lead, grousing about noisy people. Route is clear
	- spot deputy with lantern at the memorial
		- Emani and Torrin go to keep him distracted
	- razvan points out where he tracked, ihrin and calvinus sneak up toward shack to investigate (nat 20, 16 on stealth)
	- ihrin uncovers a bit of her hooded lantern to provide directional light
		- Calvinus discovers the waterskin and razor under some firewood
	- they get back to razvan who gets the other two. Everyone meets at the bridge and returns to the Lorrimor Place.
		- the razor has a distinctive etching on the blade

Everyone calls it a night and has fitful sleep.

Day 3
## Arresting Gibs
The next morning the group heads to the jail to present their evidence to Sheriff Caeller. He was skeptical until he looked closely at the war razor and recognized the engraving as the company crest that Gibs served with. He had his deputies go arrest Gibs.
- Gibs was furious and accused the group of framing him, but the sheriff was firm that there was enough evidence to hold him.

## Harrowstone Grounds
Emani was very interested in checking out this notorious Harrowstone. Razvan was supportive, Ihrin liked anything other than researching boring tomes, Calvinus was hesitant, Torrin was sure, why not.
