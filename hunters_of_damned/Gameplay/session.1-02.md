## Day One

### The Desecrated Memorial
Torrin and Razvan were up while most everyone else nursed hangovers and went for a run. During the run, they noticed a small crowd gathered at the Harrowstone Memorial. Curious they went over to investigate and witness the bloody 'V' on the memorial and blood splatter all around. 

- sheriff acts dismissive, blaming young punks playing some prank.
- Gibs comes out to investigate the fuss. Denies having heard anything last night and blames the strangers
- The situation starts to become heated, but the sheriff puts an end to it

Torrin and Razvan return to Lorrinor Place, where Kendra had some breakfast ready. Calvinus, still puking his guts out and sure that he would have to get better in order to die, had no interest in breakfast, and Ihrin continued to sleep in. The others enjoyed the light repast that Kendra had prepared. Following breakfast, Razvan perused the Professor's journal. Ludmilla hung out with Kendra and Torrin, who caught up and shared more stories about the Professor.

### The Sheriff Returns
A slow knock on the door shortly before noon, revealed Sherrif Caeller.

### Research
- After getting his stomach back under control, but still not ready to eat, Calvinus collaborated with Kendra to research the Whispering Way using the house library.
	- (17 Int Arcana) no additional clues found
- Ludmilla and Torrin go check out the local farmer's market that gathers every Wealday
	- the locals are pretty aloof to Torrin, but as a cleric of Pharasma, Ludmilla gets some to open up a bit. Inquiring about Harrowstone, she learns: Now and then, if you visit Harrowstone near sundown, you can hear the ghost of the wardenâ€™s wife wailing and sobbing from somewhere within the ruins. She haunts the prison now, forever mourning her husband and attempting to frighten anyone who intrudes on the prison.



## Day 2
### Another Chat with Father Grimburrow
Ludmilla was able to gain an audience with Father Grimburrow. Upon questioning about the supposed 'secret cache', the priest stated that his acolytes had investigated and found no such thing.
