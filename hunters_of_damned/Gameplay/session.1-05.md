# Gameplay Session 1-05
This session starts on the morning of Day 5.

## Repercussions
Grave caretakers found the disturbed graves and destroyed skeletons. Acolytes of the temple investigated and also found the crypt unlocked and disturbed. Father Grimburrow, needless to say, was quite irate and summoned Kendra and the party to the temple, presuming them to be the likely culprits.
- Ihrin managed to quell the priest's anger (21 Charisma (Deception), and Luda assured him that nothing nefarious occurred. Razvan added that foul forces were strengthening at the prison and must be dealt with.
- Father Grimburrow warned them to stay out of the Restlands or he would have them all driven out of town.

## Back to Harrowstone
Get back to the prison grounds before noon. No odd effects as they walked through the main gate. They decided to fully investigate the prison grounds and perimeter before proceeding into the prison itself. First stop was checking the delapidated house.

### Warden's House (R3)
- Despite Torrin's assertion that the building was structurally unsound, Ihrin was determined to investigate, stating 'no risk no reward'
	- just a few minutes into investigation, a partial collapse occurred. Ihrin managed to dodge the falling debris (17 Dex save).
After its clear that everyone was okay, the team proceeded on, deciding to investigate the exterior guard towers. Marching order going up the stairs
1. Ihrin and Razvan
2. Torrin and Calvinus
3. Ludmilla

### The Tower Rat Swarm
The rats became obvious as the party approached. The group approached cautiously and were unsurprised when two swarms surged from the observation tower.
1. Razvan
2. Ihrin
3. Calvinus
4. Rats
5. Ludmilla
6. Torrin

#### Round 1
- Razvan peformed blood rite before a mighty sweep of glaive at oncoming swarm (8 hp). lightning crackled through the swarm.
- Ihrin dashed to the northern wall and fired an arrow into the second charging swarm, but to no discernable effect
- Calvinus struck the second swarm with a repelling eldritch blast (2 hp) pushing it back into the tower.
- The first swarm surged over Razvan, but failed to penetrate his armor.
- The second swarm dashed but failed to reach Torrin or Calvinus
- Ludmilla cast sacred flame on the second swarm (8 hp)
- Torrin tore into the second swarm with battleaxe and shield (4 hp)

#### Round 2
- Razvan dropped his glaive and drew a dagger to deal with the swarm (2 hp)
- Ihrin bobbed in with a dagger to help Razvan and then disengaged (4hp)
- Calvinus struck the second swarm with another repelling eldritch blast (8 hp)
- The first swarm continued gnawing on Razvan
- The small remains of the second swarm surged to Torrin, but he held them off with his shield
- Ludmilla used her mace to help finish off the second swarm
- Torrin went to aid Razvan with a dagger (5hp)

#### Round 3
- Razvan continued to cut away rats with his dagger (3 hp)
- Ihrin accidentally cut Razvan (5 hp) < oops! so sorry!! >
- Calvinus held back
- The small reamins of the first swarm continued biting, but found no flesh
- Ludmilla cast cure wounds on Razvan
- Torrin finished off the remaining rats in the swarm

Quick inspection of both observation towers yielded nothing of particular interest.
