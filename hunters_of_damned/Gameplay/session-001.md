## The Burial
On the morning of the funeral, the five strangers arrived as directed to the entrance of the Restlands at the appointed time. Kendra Lorrimor was already there, along with a few local citizens who were old friends of the deceased professor.
+ Councilman Vashian Hearthmount
+ Councilman Gharen Muricar
+ Zohar Elkarid, the local tavern keeper
+ Perrin Elkarid, the tavern keeper’s son
+ Jominda Fallenbridge, the apothecary

Upon Gibs challenge, Torrin moved to stand beside Kendra. Emani challenged Gibs and the local thugs (22 Diplomacy roll) and broke their resolve. They sullenly dispersed, shooting venomous glances at the party and Kendra. Gibs spat out a final threat as he departed
>This is not over woman!

Kendra thanked Emani profusely and apologized for the assault. The attending councilors professed shock at the attack
+ recognized toughs as local farmhands, all of low character
+ identify the ringleader as Gibs Hephanus, a retired soldier

Father Grimburrow arrived moments later and also expresses shock at the audacity of the confrontation.
>"My Friends, I am terribly sorry for the behavior that Gibs has shown today. These people know better than to intrude upon the holy rites of Pharasma. I will be sure to speak with the town sheriff and make sure that they are properly disciplined. Let us continue with this solemn task."

The procession continued without further complication to the plot, where the pallbearers hand over the coffin to the gravediggers who lowered it into the open grave. 
+ Father Grimburrow gave a short sermon. 
+ Kendra, fighting back tears, briefly recounted a few of her father’s more courageous or selfless moments and thanked everyone again for coming. 

She then invited others to share stories or remembrances. Each party member recounted how they knew the professor.
+ Razvan gave an uplifting account of the professor’s commitment to broadening knowledge (18 Diplomacy roll)
+ Torrin gave a very short statement of how he save the professor’s life (3 Diplomacy roll)
+ Emani gave an especially moving account of how the professor inspired her (25 Diplomacy roll)
+ Ihrin gave a mirthful but appropriate of her favorite job for the professor (11 Diplomacy roll)
+ Calvinus gave an uninspiring and vague account of his interactions with the professor (3 Diplomacy roll)

Upon the conclusion of the funeral, Kendra said her goodbyes to the other guests and then invited the PCs to her home for a drink and to hear his last will and testament.
+ Councilman Vashian Hearthmount must be present at the reading, but has some other matters that he must first attend to. He should arrive in about an hour.
