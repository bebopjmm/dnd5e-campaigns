# Gameplay Session 1-04
This session starts on the morning of Day 4.

## Individual Pursuits
- Calvinus spent most of the day in deep research at the manor house.
	- hits the motherload on the Whispering Way (25 Intelligence (Arcana))
		- The Whispering Way itself is a series of philosophies that can only be transferred via whispers— the philosophies are never written or spoken of loudly, making the exact goals and nature of the secretive philosophy difficult for outsiders to learn much about.
		- Exact details on the society are difficult to discern, but chief among the Whispering Way’s goals are discovering formulae for creating liches and engineering the release of the Whispering Tyrant. Agents often travel to remote sites or areas plagued by notorious haunts or undead menaces to perform field research or even to capture unique monsters. Their symbol is a gagged skull, and those who learn too many of the Way’s secrets are often murdered, and their mouths mutilated to prevent their bodies from divulging secrets via speak with dead.
- Everyone else goes into town
	- Razvan notices the skipping song and finds it peculiar.

After a nice evening meal, everyone preps for the night excursion

## Into the Restlands
The group is able to make their way unnoticed from the Lorrimore Place to the southeastern entrance to the Restlands. Ihrin leads with a hooded lantern, the group stays close to each other on the Black Path.

### First Rising
As they group is passing a group of three mausoleums, a scrathing noise catches Calinus's attention. Ihrin turned the lantern to the area he indicated just in time to see a skeletal corpse start pulling itself from the ground. Scanning the area three more skeletons are spotted...

- Skeletons: 20
- Torrin: 18
- Razvan: 15
- Luda: 13
- Ihrin: 9
- Cal: 4

#### Round 1
- skeleton 1 closed on Ihrin and slashed her with its claws (4hp)
- skeleton 2 closed on cal and slashed him with its claws (4hp)
- skeleton 3 closed on luda and slahed her with its claws (4hp)
- Torrin moved to aid luda and struck skeleton 3 (7hp)
- Razvan moved to aid Ihrin and struck skeleton 1 (10 hp)
- Luda destroyed skeleton 3 with her mace (12 hp)
- Ihrin disengaged to get behind Razvan
- Cal disengaged to take cover behind Torrin

#### Round 2
- skeleton 1 closed on Razvan, but he fends off its claw attack
- skeleton 2 closed on Torrin and slashes him with its claws (4hp)
- Torrin destroys skeleton 2 with a powerful swing of his battleaxe (crit - 18 hp)
- Razvan destroyed skeleton 1 with his glaive (12 hp)

### Rest In Peace
After the combat, Luda cured Cal and Ihrins wounds. Torrin's second wind takes care of his wounds. Calvinus notices one the the headstones glowing near where the skeletons rose up. A fiery inscription reads
>Ihrin Tomovici ~ Come to my world, and be as I; as I am now, soon you will be; embrace your end and witness me ~ Died 4661 AR

Ihrin and Cal are both ready to get back to Lorrimor Place, but Razvan pressed that they needed to find the hidden cache. Luda uses inspiring leadership to bolster everyone (and grant 3hp)

### The False Crypt
It doesn't take long to find the referenced crypt. Investigating the door, Ihrin quickly notices that the lock clasp has been burned through with acid and reset to give the impression of working. Entering, Calvinus pointed out faint tracks leading down the steps. Razvan was able to follow them to a sarcophagus.
- Torrin and Razvan work together to remove the lid to find the cache of materials

And then the giant centipedes attacked.
- Cal: 20 (surprised)
- Giant Centipedes: 19
- Ihrin: 17 (surprised)
- Torrin: 14 (surprised)
- Razvan: 9
- Luda: 9 (surprised

### Round 1
- centipede 1 bit Ihrin (4hp + 10-failed save) paralyzing her with its poison
- centipede 2 bit Cal (4hp + 10-failed save) paralyzing him with its poison
- Razvan missed centipede 2

### Round 2
- centipede 1 bit Torrin (4hp passed save)
- centipede 2 bit Razvan (4hp passed save)
- Torrin slays centipede 1
- Razvan fumbles his glaive trying to fend off centipede 2
- Luda squishes centipede 2

Luda uses *spare the dying* to ensure Cal and Irhin are stable. The plan quickly changed to 
1. grab all the stuff
2. get the hell back to the manor where hopefully Cal and Ihrin can be treated

## Back at the Manor
The poison wore off after about an hour. Luda used her remaining healing spells. It was now safe to investigate the haul from the crypt.
