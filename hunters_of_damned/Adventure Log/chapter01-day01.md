# Day 1
## The Burial of Professor Lorrimor 
The sun had been up for hours, but the chill fog blanketing the little Ustalavian town of Ravengro refused to release its grip. A small group had gathered around a casket outside the Restlands, a large stretch of moorland reserved for interring Ravengro’s dead. The group included five individuals that were clearly strangers to the town, two men heavily cloaked to ward off the chill, a woman in vestments of Pharasma, a half-elf woman also heavily cloaked, and a burly dwarf in armor. The townsfolk nodded at the strangers, but no warmer welcome was forthcoming.  
A gentleman accompanied by a young woman strode from town to the cemetery entrance  where the group was gathered. A large middle-aged man, poshly dressed, the gentleman was clearly a town citizen of import. The young woman dressed in dark conservative clothes was quite attractive although her eyes were red and puffy. She warmly greeted each of the locals by name and thanked them for coming. She then turned to the strangers with mix of curiosity, sadness, and relief.  
> “I am Kendra Lorrimor. Each of you has my deepest gratitude for answering my late father’s request. I feared the summons would not reach you in time”

%% have kendra greet each of the heroes, using this opportunity to introduce and briefly describe them

Nodding at the gentleman who accompanied her she added with a sigh,
>“Councilman Hearthmount will conduct the reading of the will shortly after the funeral service. With things the way they are in town these days, I suppose this may be everyone.”

Councilman Hearthmount spoke up, his tone comforting yet patronizing,
>“We should proceed, Kendra. Father Grimburrow is no doubt waiting for us at the site. It would seem appropriate for the late Professor’s requested attendees to serve as pallbearers.”

After a brief awkward pause, the humans and half-elf positioned themselves around the casket and lifted it. The dwarf being much shorter, decided to fall in line behind the casket, ahead to the local citizens. Kendra Lorrimor then led the procession into the cemetery along the gravel walkway.  
As the route curved round and intersected another pathway, a group of surly looking locals came into view through the fog. The tallest, an elderly but wiry man, stepped forward. As he raised his arms, the other local toughs spread out, blocking the pathway and halting the procession.
>“That’s far enough.” the old man spat, “We been talkin’ and we don’t want Lorrimor buried in the Restlands. You can take him upriver and bury’m there if you want, but he ain’t goin’ in the ground here amongst decent folk!”

The initial shock on Kendra’s face quickly gave way to fierce anger.
>“What are you talking about, Gibs? I’ve arranged this with Father Grimburrow. He’s waiting for us! The grave’s already been..”

But the old man strode forward menacingly, interrupting her
>“You don’t get it woman. We won’t have no necromancer buried in the same place as our kin. I suggest you move out while you still can. Good folk are pretty upset about this right now.”

At this point the dwarf strode to stand beside Kendra. Realizing the situation was about to get out of hand, the priestess of Pharasma spoke up,

%% Challenge to Gibs and local thugs that breaks their resolve  
They sullenly dispersed, shooting venomous glances at the party and Kendra. Gibs spat out a final threat as he departed
>This is not over woman!

Father Grimburrow arrived moments later and also expresses shock at the audacity of the confrontation.
>"My Friends, I am terribly sorry for the behavior that Gibs has shown today. These people know better than to intrude upon the holy rites of Pharasma. I will be sure to speak with the town sheriff and make sure that they are properly disciplined. Let us continue with this solemn task."

The procession continued without further complication to the plot, where the pallbearers hand over the coffin to the gravediggers who lowered it into the open grave. Father Grimburrow gave a short sermon, and then Kendra, fighting back tears, briefly recounted a few of her father’s more courageous or selfless moments . She then invited others to share stories or remembrances. Each party member recounted how they knew the professor.

%%+ Razvan gave an uplifting account of the professor’s commitment to broadening knowledge (18 Diplomacy roll)

%%+ Torrin gave a very short statement of how he save the professor’s life (3 Diplomacy roll)

%%+ Emani gave an especially moving account of how the professor inspired her (25 Diplomacy roll)

%%+ Ihrin gave a mirthful but appropriate of her favorite job for the professor (11 Diplomacy roll)

%%+ Calvinus gave an uninspiring and vague account of his interactions with the professor (3 Diplomacy roll)

Upon the conclusion of the funeral, Kendra said her goodbyes to the other guests and then invited the PCs to her home for a drink and to hear his last will and testament.

%%+ Councilman Vashian Hearthmount must be present at the reading, but has some other matters that he must first attend to. He should arrive in about an hour.
