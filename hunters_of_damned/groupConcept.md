# Carrion Crown Group Concept
## Style of Play
This campaign features a gothic horror theme, so I want to stick to a dark, grim, and eerie style of play.

**Story-driven Leveling:** I will hand out experience as I see fit to trigger leveling at designated points of my choosing that will be tied to storyline progress.
 
## Group Template
**Group Concept:** 
**Shared History:**  none of the characters have previous knowledge or interactions 

### Character Ideas
- good campaign for witch hunter class
- Cleric undead hunter is a natural fit
- Fighter 
- Warlock seems appropriate but may need wizard for bookworm role
- Rogue is a must
### Hero Roster
- **Razvan Dobrescu**: Wizard or Witch Hunter (Making Good on Promises) - The troubled soul
	Former student and researcher at the University of Lepidstadt. Cursed birth. Character concept is a troubled academic obsessed with finding a cure for his curse and very willing to delve into forbidden knowledge. 
	+ hook: completing the will request will not only satisfy the debt but also yield location of an important tome that Razvan has been searching for
- **Emani Tavitier**: Cleric (Inspired by Greatness) - the idealist 
	Cleric of Pharasma (healing and repose)
	Character concept is a committed shepherd and protector of the people. Member of a relatively new and somewhat disruptive order of Pharasma. Emani is the moral compass of the group.
- **Torrin Grimhood**: Fighter (Chance Savior) - the protector 
	Character concept is a dour and aloof dwarf who cares little for great heroic deeds, but is fiercely protective of those he considers his brothers in arms. He also has no tolerance for tyranny, bullying, or oppression.
- **Ihrin Tomovici**: Rogue (On the Payroll) - the professional 
	Character concept is an ambitious rogue
	+ hook: completing the will request will result in buyout of her 'contract' with guild
+ **Calvinus Asina**: Wizard, Warlock, or Witch Hunter (Teacher's Pet) - the bookworm
