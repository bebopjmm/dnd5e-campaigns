## NPCs of Note

### Grigor Dunhold

*Human male. Farmer. Tall.*
- **Ideal**: The world beyond our walls is a crazy, dangerous place. The common people like me need to stay together if we’re going to be safe.
- **Bond**: The village of Frickley has been my home all my life. I’d give anything to keep it safe.
- **Flaw**: Outsiders, especially ones that act as though they’re better than us, are always trying to exploit the common people.

### Tastra Fleetstrong

*Half-Elf female. Hunter. Red hair.*
- **Ideal**: In the wild, the most important thing is making sure you can take care of yourself and your family.
- **Bond**: Frickley has been good to me over the years, but villages are made of people, not houses.
- **Flaw**: I have no respect for anybody who can’t make themselves useful or who doesn’t show ambition. Who would want to spend their entire life tending to the same field over and over again?
