# The Giantslayer, session 02

Pello had a big breakfast prepared for the heroes before they set out with Bayle. They left the horses behind, as the trip through the forest would be easier on foot. Weeping Rock Trail began a few hundred yards east of the village gates and quickly disappeared into the High Forest.

After half a mile or so the trail forked, with the right-hand path appearing to be slightly more worn. Bayle said that the right-hand fork would take them to a bridge over a small river, while the left one would require them to climb over stepping-stones, though it’s quieter and less likely to have any trouble on the path. He told them crossed using the stepping-stones on his previous journey.

- if on her own, Salisha would take the left fork, but she is dubious about all of the others handling the stepping-stones.

The party travelled the right-hand path.

## Fallen Tree

A little ways down the path, prior to reaching the bridge, the group came upon a huge tree - much larger than any of the others they've seen in the forest – lying at an angle across the path. The smell of damp and rot wafted towards them, and the ripple of vast insects moving across the trunk was apparent.

- Bayle seemed undaunted, suggested the insects probably won't bother them unless the group attracts their attention with a loud noise.
- Going around the tree would involve leaving the trail for a significant distance.

There are plenty of handholds on the tree, so everyone attempted to stealthily climb over. The climbing went fine, the 'stealthiness', well not so much. Three giant centipedes attacked!

### Round 1

- Ademar saw the oncoming centipedes, drew his rapier and stabbed GS-1, killing it.
- Kylantha backed away from the tree and hurled an acid splash, but the centipede dodged it
- GS-3 attempted to bite Urimo, but the halfling fended it off
- Drawing his longsword, Urimo hacked GS-3 in half
- Vezoth smashed the third and final centipede with his mace

Everyone good, they pressed onward.

## The Bridge

A few hundred yards down from the fallen tree was an old stone bridge, and after that the path forks again. Bayle thought the left fork would take them to the path he followed two years ago. The group decides to follow Bayle's recommendation.

## The Pyramid of Ice

The forest path curved to the north. The air ahead seemed to be getting strangely cold, and upon rounding the corner the heroes could see why. In the middle of a small clearing was a pyramid that appears to be made entirely of ice. Sitting maybe five feet tall, in the very center they could just make out a glittering blue speck. It’s hard to get close, however, as all around its base was a thick tangle of thorny bushes.

- Salisha commented that the structure was obviously not natural
- Bayle believed it to clearly be fey magic and they should leave it alone
- Kylantha (23 Intelligence(Arcana)) agreed that it was a magical construct, but was skeptical that fey magic was the source
- Ademar's curiousity got the best of him and he touched the structure, causing the entire pyramid to crack and shatter into thousands of pieces

Two small winged humanoids made entirely of ice emerged and attacked!

### Round 1

- Ademar stabbed at IM-1 with his rapier, hitting (9 hp)
- Urimo engaged IM-2 with his longsword, hitting (7 hp)
- Vezoth cast bless, affecting himself, Urimo and Salisha
- Kylantha backed away 30 and cast magic missile with all 3 bolts hitting IM-1 (11 hp) and killing it
	- death burst (Ademar saves 2hp, Urimo takes full brunt 6hp)
- Salisha draws her shortswords and engaged IM-2, hitting with both
- IM-2 exhaled a 15ft cone of frigid air (Urimo, Salisha, Vezoth)
	- thanks to Vezoth's blessing everyone saved for half dmg (3hp)

### Round 2

- Ademar stabbed at IM-2 with his rapier, killing it (12 hp)
	- death burst (Ademar, Urimo, Salisha all save for 3hp)
	- Urimo falls dying from his wounds, but Vezoth quickly stabilizes him with spare the dying
