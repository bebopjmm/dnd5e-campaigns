# The Giantslayer, session 02

Pello had a big breakfast prepared for the heroes before they set out with Bayle. They left the horses behind, as the trip through the forest would be easier on foot. Weeping Rock Trail began a few hundred yards east of the village gates and quickly disappeared into the High Forest.

After half a mile or so the trail forked, with the right-hand path appearing to be slightly more worn. Bayle said that the right-hand fork would take them to a bridge over a small river, while the left one would require them to climb over stepping-stones, though it’s quieter and less likely to have any trouble on the path. He told them crossed using the stepping-stones on his previous journey.

- if on her own, Salisha would take the left fork, but she is dubious about all of the others handling the stepping-stones.

The party travelled the right-hand path.

## Fallen Tree

A little ways down the path, prior to reaching the bridge, the group came upon a huge tree - much larger than any of the others they've seen in the forest – lying at an angle across the path. The smell of damp and rot wafted towards them, and the ripple of vast insects moving across the trunk was apparent.

- Bayle seemed undaunted, suggested the insects probably won't bother them unless the group attracts their attention with a loud noise.
- Going around the tree would involve leaving the trail for a significant distance.

There are plenty of handholds on the tree, so everyone attempted to stealthily climb over. The climbing went fine, the 'stealthiness', well not so much. Three giant centipedes attacked!

### Round 1

- Rantigan saw the oncoming centipedes, drew his rapier and stabbed GS-1, killing it.
- Kylantha backed away from the tree and hurled an acid splash, but the centipede dodged it
- GS-3 attempted to bite Bodalf, but the barbarian fended it off
- Bodalf hacked GS-3 in half with his greataxe
- Vezoth smashed the third and final centipede with his mace

Everyone good, they pressed onward.

## The Bridge

A few hundred yards down from the fallen tree was an old stone bridge, and after that the path forks again. Bayle thought the left fork would take them to the path he followed two years ago. The group decides to follow Bayle's recommendation.

## The Pyramid of Ice

The forest path curved to the north. The air ahead seemed to be getting strangely cold, and upon rounding the corner the heroes could see why. In the middle of a small clearing was a pyramid that appears to be made entirely of ice. Sitting maybe five feet tall, in the very center they could just make out a glittering blue speck. It’s hard to get close, however, as all around its base was a thick tangle of thorny bushes.

- Salisha commented that the structure was obviously not natural
- Bayle believed it to clearly be fey magic and they should leave it alone
- Kylantha (23 Intelligence(Arcana)) agreed that it was a magical construct, but was skeptical that fey magic was the source
- Rantigan's curiousity got the best of him and he touched the structure, causing the entire pyramid to crack and shatter into thousands of pieces

Two small winged humanoids made entirely of ice emerged and attacked!

### Round 1

- Bodalf entered a rage and struck IM-1 with his greataxe (13hp)
- Rantigan stabbed at IM-1 with his rapier, killing it (14hp)
	- death burst (Bodalf, Rantigan both save )
- Kylantha backed away 30 and cast magic missile with all 3 bolts hitting IM-2 (11 hp)
- Vezoth struck IM-2 with his mace, shattering it (14 hp)
	- death burst (Vezoth, Salisha both save)


### Babano

Everyone takes a short rest. 

- Everyone injured used their healing during the rest. 
- Kylantha performed arcane recovery
- Rantigan retrieved a sizable blue gem from the now melting ice shards
	- its a sapphire and quite valuable (10 Intelligence for appraisal)
- Bayle asked what manner of fey creature those were. Kylantha realized they were ice mephits, capricious, imp-like creatures native to the elemental planes and not actual fey. 

At this point, they group heard a tuneless whistling approaching them from further down the path. Drawing her bow, Salisha called out to the person to identify themselves. An older man, obviously a woodsman, came sautering around the corner, oblivious to Salisha's call. She was about to call out again when he noticed the group, and greeted them.

- Babano introduced himself and thanked the group for taking care of the pesky mephits
	- commented about the death burst and offered 6 goodberries, which the group accepted with thanks
	- Vezoth took 2, everyone else took 1

Babano asked what had brought the party into the High Forest.

- explained the plight of Frickley and task to find Jahia Giantslayer
- Babano commented on increased giant activity, but wasn't familiar with Jahia
- Babano warned the party that a squirrel told him that something foul has taken up residence at Weeping Rock in recent weeks.

Babano bid the group farewell and good luck before sauntering into the forest, resuming his tuneless whistle.

## Weeping Rock

The path continued to wind uphill for some time, but eventually the trees begin to thin out and the group find themselves following a fast-flowing stream. Coming to the top of a small rise they spotted the source of the water - the ‘Weeping Rock’ itself.
Weeping Rock was a grey boulder easily standing 50’ high and topped with moss. From the group's view, the huge rock bore a striking resemblance to a stony face with a low cave for a mouth and craggy nose. A steady gush of water flowed from two wide holes that resemble sad, weeping eyes, before flowing down the hill.

Remembering the druid's warning, the group approached with caution. Salisha decided to scout the area alone (for stealth).

- She noticed a large number of bones in the water at the base of the rock (12 Wisdom (Perception))

Reporting back to the group, they decide to attempt at sneaking past the stone.

- Vezoth and Bodalf will lead, with Rantigan a bit further back
- Salisha, Kylantha and Bayle will trail and provide cover fire if anything reveals itself

As soon as Vezoth, Bodalf and Rantigan got with 150' of her lair, the harpy unleashed her *luring song*. Unfortunately everone was within range of the effect (DC 11 Wisdom save).
