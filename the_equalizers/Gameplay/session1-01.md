# The Giantslayer, session 01

The party departed the town of Beliard the previous day enroute to the small hamlet of Frickley. The campsite known by Salisha was comfortable enough and secure, and the night passed without incident. The following morning proved to be a fine spring day, temperate with cloudy skies that hinted at rain. The rolling plains had given way to a light forest as the group followed an overgrown dirt road that wends its way through the trees.

- Kylantha was on her riding horse and Rantigan rode the pony, Sparkleheart
- everyone else was on foot 

## Foul Fey

Suddenly shouts and cries from up ahead were heard. Rounding the corner they saw an old cart perhaps a hundred yards down the road. Salisha identified the creatures harrassing the cart to be satyrs. Everyone agreed that they had to aid the travelers.

- Salisha and Bodalf dashed down one side of the road, while Vezoth, Kylantha, and Rantigan dashed down the other side.
- They got within 180 ft without being noticed

### Surprise Round

- Bodalf dashed to 120' away
- Salisha closed to 150' and fired an arrow at Satyr (6hp)
- Rantigan dashed to 130' away
- Kylantha dashed to 120' away
- Vezoth dashed to 120' away

### Round 1

- Satyr-pp turned and approached 40' and drew out his panpipes
- Bodalf dashed to 20' away from Satyr-pp
- Salisha targeted Satyr-pp (9hp)
- Rantigan closed to 65' from Satyr-p and fired an arrow 
- Satyr left the wagon and fired at Bodalf, missing
- Kylantha launched 3 magic missiles at Satyr-p (11hp)
- Vezoth closed to 80/50' and called down *sacred flame* on Satyr-p, but the satyr dodged the spell

### Round 2
- Satyr-p played a *frightening strain* before bolting towards the woods
	- Vezoth, Bodalf both successfully saved versus the effect
- Bodalf closed with Satyr and entering a rage swung his greataxe (16hp)
- Salisha targeted the fleeing Satyr-p, but missed
- Rantigan targeted the fleeing Satry-p (6hp) killing it
- Satyr disengaged from Bodalf, attempting to flee to woods
- Kylantha launch 3 magic missiles at fleeing Satyr (12hp) killing it

### Conclusion

The group searched over the corpses of the satyrs and checked on the family

- Each party member earned 40 XP
- Rantigan kept the pan pipes

## The Family

Talked to the shaken family, and rode with them the rest of the way into Frickley, learning of the woes of their village of Scorton.

- questions for the family?
- Kylantha short rested for arcane recovery

## The Frickley Decision

The group arrived at Frickley by mid-afternoon to a hastily patched up main gate being held together with rope.

- simple task for Salisha to untie the gate
- while doing so she noticed the giant footprints, most likely hill giant

While village initially seemed deserted, the group heard raised voices as they neared the Blue Duke inn. They entered to to find the inn filled to capacity with villagers, all talking over each other and banging angrily on tables. As soon as they enter the commotion ceased and the inn became uncomfortably silent. 

### Introductions
Ithro Addelm recognized Salisha at once, welcomed her, and bid that she introduce her comrades.

- Salisha explained that she had brought the pony, Sparkleheart, and made the introductions
- Rantigan stayed quiet regarding his business
- Kylantha proclaimed that she had arrived in response to Nilril Graybow's request of her master, Leomenor.
	- Nilril was ill-pleased that a mere apprentice be sent to satisfy the debt, but Ithro bade her welcome and that any aid she could bring to the village's plight would be most appreciated.
- Vezoth explained he was tasked with guarding Kylantha and would continue to do so
- Bodalf proclaimed his Thunderbeast tribe membership and that he brought warnings of increased giant activity throughout the lands 

This segued into Ithro explaining the village's current plight.

### The Giant's Ultimatum
Ithro Addhelm explained that Frickley has been visited by Bonecruncher the previous day. The gruesome hill giant laid down an ultimatum that the village must offer up all its food, or else. The giant is due to return in three days.

- Tastra spoke out on behalf of the hunters that a hill giant is beyond the village's ability to deal with and that the village should be abandoned.
- Grigor spoke out on behalf of the farmers that the village should simply acceed to the giant's demands and that he will go away.
- At that point, Randur piped up and related the harrowing tragedy at Scorton.
	- his brother Andel vouched for his integrity
	- villagers enter into a panic
- Vezoth was inclined that the best the group could do was aid in protecting the villagers in fleeing to another location, perhaps taking them to Brinewick until the threat can be handled.
- Rantigan was fully supportive of not hanging around.
- Bodalf accepted the fact that a hill giant was far beyond their ability to handle.

### Legend of the Giantslayer

With abandoning the village gaining support, Pello jumped onto a table, proclaimed his desire to fight for the village, and related the legend of Jahia Giantslayer. He proposed the brave newcomers go plead the village's plight and bring Jahia to aid in defending the village.

- lots of doubters in the crowd
- Salisha was quite familiar with the stories, as her father adventured with Jahia for a time, and knew that Jahia was still alive in the area.
- Bodalf was enthused with the idea
- Kylantha got Nilril to agree that retrieving Jahia to aid the village would satisfy the debt. Vezoth goes were Kylantha goes.
- Rantigan was torn, but sticking with the group seemed safer than with these hopeless yokels, and the payment was tempting

Under Salisha's advisement, the group chose Bayle as their guide.

- She had a personal dislike of Sholt.

### Stay or Go?

At Pello's request the party made the pitch to the leaders to stay and fight. Vezoth tried inspiring the others to stay and fight, aided by Bodalf and Salisha.

- advantage on the Charisma (Persuade) attempt -> 22

Inspired by the newcomers words, even Tastra was won over. After a brief private conference, the town council advised that preparations to evacuate continue while the heroes fetch Jahia. If they returned successfully, defensive tactics would be planned, but until then the fallback recourse must be made viable.

- privately Ithro congratulated Salisha, saying that her father would be proud of her actions.

As it already approaching evening, the heroes would set out in the morning.
