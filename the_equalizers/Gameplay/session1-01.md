# The Giantslayer, session 01

The party departed the village of Berkton the previous day enroute to the small hamlet of Frickley. The campsite known by Salisha was comfortable enough and secure, the night passing without incident. The spring day was temperate with cloudy skies, hinting at rain. Rolling plains have given way to a light forest as you follow an overgrown dirt road that wends its way through the trees.

## Foul Fey

Suddenly shouts and cries from up ahead were heard. Rounding the corner they saw an old cart perhaps a hundred yards down the road.

- Salisha identified the creatures harrassing the cart to be satyrs.
- The group rode hard toward the cart, one of the satyrs heard the approach. Everyone except Urimo ended up 150' away from the cart, while his pony is 200' away.
	- Kylantha cast mage armor on herself

### Round 1
- Kylantha closed to range for her acid splash spell (60')
- Ademar closed to range for his short bow (80')
- Satyr-1 whooped out obscenities and crude taunts and it drew its shortbow and fired at Kylantha, striking her for 8 hp.
	- she fell from her horse, dying
- Urimo dashed. now 120' away.
- Satyr-2 also yelled crude taunts while continuing to harass the commoners.
- Salisha dismounted with her bow, but missed Satyr-1.
- Vezoth dashed to where Kylantha fell

### Round 2
- Kylantha succeeded at stabilizing roll
- Ademar dismounted and fired at Satyr-1, missing
- Satyr-1 fired at Vezoth, but failed to penetrate his armor
- Urimo dashed, now 40' away
- Satyr-2 approached 20' and played a frightening strain DC 13 Wis on his panpipes (Urimo, Vezoth, and Ademar in range).
	- Ademar frightened, Vezoth unaffected, Urimo unaffected
- Salisha moved a bit closer and nailed Satyr-2 (11 hp)
- Vezoth dismounted and cast spare the dying on Kylantha

### Round 3
- Kylantha is stabilized
- Ademar tried to shoot at Satyr-2, but his fear made his shot go very wide
- Satyr-1 fired at Urimo, but it hit the shield
- Urimo engaged Satyr-2, striking him with his sword (7 hp)
- Satyr-2 disengages towards the woods
- Salisha nailed Satyr-2 again 
- Vezoth called down sacred flame on Satyr-1 (3 hp)

### Conclusion
As the satyrs broke away and fled, Salisha called out to let them go - they could easily lead us into a trap.

- Vezoth healed Kylantha's wounds, giving her a rebuke for not keeping to a safe distance.
	- Kylantha apologized for getting swept up in the moment
	- Salisha applauded her fighting spirit
- Each party member earned 40 XP

## The Family

Talked to the shaken family, and rode with them the rest of the way into Frickley, learning of the woes of their village of Scorton.

- questions for the family?

## The Frickley Decision

The group arrived at Frickley by mid-afternoon to a hastily patched up main gate being held together with rope.

- simple task for Salisha to untie the gate
- while doing so she noticed the giant footprints, most likely hill giant

While village initially seemed deserted, the group heard raised voices as they neared the Blue Duke inn. They entered to to find the inn filled to capacity with villagers, all talking over each other and banging angrily on tables. As soon as they enter the commotion ceased and the inn became uncomfortably silent. 

### Introductions
Ithro Addelm recognized Salisha at once, welcomed her, and bid that she introduce her comrades.

- Salisha explained that she had brought the horse, Sparkleheart, and made the introductions
- Kylantha proclaimed that she had arrived in response to Nilril Graybow's request of her master, Leomenor.
	- Nilril was ill-pleased that a mere apprentice be sent to satisfy the debt, but Ithro bade her welcome and that any aid she could bring to the village's plight would be most appreciated.
- Urimo offered his sword and shield to the aid of the village
- Vezoth explained he was tasked with guarding Kylantha and would continue to do so
- Ademar ... 

### The Crisis
Ithro Addhelm explained that Frickley has been visited by Bonecruncher the previous day. The gruesome hill giant laid down an ultimatum that the village must offer up all its food, or else. The giant is due to return in three days.

- Tastra spoke out on behalf of the hunters that a hill giant is beyond the village's ability to deal with and that the village should be abandoned.
- Grigor spoke out on behalf of the farmers that the village should simply acceed to the giant's demands and that he will go away.
- At that point, Randur piped up and related the harrowing tragedy at Scorton.
	- his brother Andel vouched for his integrity
	- villagers enter into a panic
- Vezoth was inclined that the best the group could do was aid in protecting the villagers in fleeing to another location, perhaps taking them to Brinewick until the threat can be handled.
- Ademar was fully supportive of not hanging around.
- Urimo accepted the fact that a hill giant was far beyond their ability to handle.

### Legend of the Giantslayer

With abandoning the village gaining support, Pello jumped onto a table, proclaimed his desire to fight for the village, and related the legend of Jahia Giantslayer. He proposed the brave newcomers go plead the village's plight and bring Jahia to aid in defending the village.

- lots of doubters in the crowd
- Salisha was quite familiar with the stories, as her father adventured with Jahia for a time, and knew that Jahia was still alive in the area.
- Urimo was enthused with the idea
- Kylantha got Nilril to agree that retrieving Jahia to aid the village would satisfy the debt. Vezoth goes were Kylantha goes.
- Ademar was torn, but sticking with the group seemed safer than with these hopeless yokels, and the payment was tempting

Under Salisha's advisement, the group chose Bayle as their guide. She had a personal dislike of Sholt.

### Stay or Go?

At Pello's request the party made the pitch to the leaders to stay and fight. Urimo tried inspiring (persuade) the others to stay and fight, aided by Vezoth and Salisha.

- advantage on the Charisma (Persuade) attempt -> 22

Inspired by the newcomers words, even Tastra was won over. After a brief private conference, the town council advised that preparations to evacuate continue while the heroes fetch Jahia. If they returned successfully, defensive tactics would be planned, but until then the fallback recourse must be made viable.

- privately Ithro congratulated Salisha, saying that her father would be proud of her actions.

As it already approaching evening, the heroes would set out in the morning.
