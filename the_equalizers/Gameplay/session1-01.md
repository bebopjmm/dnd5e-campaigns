# The Giantslayer, session 01

The party departed the village of Berkton the previous day enroute to the small hamlet of Frickley. The campsite known by Salisha was comfortable enough and secure, the night passing without incident. The spring day was temperate with cloudy skies, hinting at rain. Rolling plains have given way to a light forest as you follow an overgrown dirt road that wends its way through the trees.

## Foul Fey

Suddenly shouts and cries from up ahead were heard. Rounding the corner they saw an old cart perhaps a hundred yards down the road.

- Salisha identified the creatures harrassing the cart to be satyrs.
- The group rode hard toward the cart, one of the satyrs heard the approach. Everyone except Urimo ended up 150' away from the cart, while his pony is 200' away.
	- Kylantha cast mage armor on herself

### Round 1
- Kylantha closed to range for her acid splash spell (60')
- Ademar closed to range for his short bow (80')
- Satyr-1 whooped out obscenities and crude taunts and it drew its shortbow and fired at Kylantha, striking her for 8 hp.
	- she fell from her horse, dying
- Urimo dashed. now 120' away.
- Satyr-2 also yelled crude taunts while continuing to harass the commoners.
- Salisha dismounted with her bow, but missed Satyr-1.
- Vezoth dashed to where Kylantha fell

### Round 2
- Kylantha succeeded at stabilizing roll
- Ademar dismounted and fired at Satyr-1, missing
- Satyr-1 fired at Vezoth, but failed to penetrate his armor
- Urimo dashed, now 40' away
- Satyr-2 approached 20' and played a frightening strain DC 13 Wis on his panpipes (Urimo, Vezoth, and Ademar in range).
	- Ademar frightened, Vezoth unaffected, Urimo unaffected
- Salisha moved a bit closer and nailed Satyr-2 (11 hp)
- Vezoth dismounted and cast spare the dying on Kylantha

### Round 3
- Kylantha is stabilized
- Ademar tried to shoot at Satyr-2, but his fear made his shot go very wide
- Satyr-1 fired at Urimo, but it hit the shield
- Urimo engaged Satyr-2, striking him with his sword (7 hp)
- Satyr-2 disengages towards the woods
- Salisha nailed Satyr-2 again 
- Vezoth called down sacred flame on Satyr-1 (3 hp)

### Conclusion
As the satyrs broke away and fled, Salisha called out to let them go - they could easily lead us into a trap.

- Vezoth healed Kylantha's wounds, giving her a rebuke for not keeping to a safe distance.
	- Kylantha apologized for getting swept up in the moment
	- Salisha applauded her fighting spirit
- Each party member earned 40 XP

## The Family

Talked to the shaken family, and rode with them the rest of the way into Frickley, learning of the woes of their village of Scorton.

- questions for the family?

## The Frickley Decision

The group arrived at Frickley by mid-afternoon to a hastily patched up main gate being held together with rope.
- simple task for Salisha to untie the gate
- while doing so she noticed the giant footprints, most likely hill giant

While village initially seemed deserted, the group heard raised voices as they neared the Blue Duke inn.
- entered to find the inn filled to capacity with villagers, all talking over each other and banging angrily on tables
- as soon as they enter the commotion ceased and the inn became uncomfortably silent
