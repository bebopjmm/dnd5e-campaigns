### Departure

Salisha's parents ensured the heroes were well provisioned and bid them safe travels.	

## The Woodhew Halflings

Salisha led the group over little known trails that would take them to Beliard. Just after mid-day, shouts and whip cracks were heard.

- Salisha and Bodalf went to scout the situation. 
- saw 10 orcs (Salisha identified them as Iceshield) pushing 4 halfling prisoners along. They were heading SW towards the heroes.

After reporting back to the others, the heroes decided so set up an ambush.

- target scouts first
- bodalf and vezoth will engage in melee, salisha and kylantha in ranged attacks, rantigan will sneak attack and attempt to free the prisoners

- Bodalf slew Orc6(16hp)
- Salisha reach Vezoth and gave him a healing potion
- Orc9 flees, but Salisha ends up sniping him

### Conclusion

Rantigan searched the dead orcs as the others rested, healed, and checked on the condition of the halfling prisoners.

- the orcs had no treasure on them, but one had a bone token bearing a strange rune
	- no one recognizes the rune, but it is doubtful that it is orcish
	- Kylantha keeps the token
- the halfings are not badly injured but bruised and shaken from the experience
	- Ollie Woodhew, one of the clan patriarchs, related the story
		- Orcs seemed to be under orders from Guh
	- Salisha is puzzled because the Iceshield lands lie more to the northeast, but the orcs were taking these prisoners southwest.

The heroes agree to take the halflings back to their homestead, a journey that takes the rest of the day.

## Evacuation to Newsham

The homestead had been torched after the pillaging, but six other family members who avoided capture had returned. The reunion was joyful. The clan decided to make for the nearby halfling village of Newsham, a half dayâ€™s travel west.

That night the heroes joined the clan in honoring the dead and celebrating the reunion.

Next day, Kylantha and Rantigan ride with halfling ahead to Newsham to arrange carts to aid in moving the halflings. They return by nightfall.

Vezoth helps tend the wounded. Bodalf and Salisha scout the area for any other threats.

The clan is packed and ready to travel the following day. The heroes decide to escort them to ensure they arrive safely.

The Heroes ended up spending a couple of days in Newsham helping with arrangements. Before they left for Beliard, the clan gave them a gift, a **cloak of elvenkind**. It was decided that the cloak should go to Salisha.
