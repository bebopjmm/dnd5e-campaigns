# The Giantslayer, session 03

## The Return to Frickley

At first light, Jahia roused everyone. The trip back to Frickley was quiet and uneventful. 

- Jahia was very downcast, muttering things like, “this will be the death of me”.Frickley was bustling with activity. True to the plan several carts laden with goods  stood outside the village palisade, along with families making preparations to go.
Returning with Jahia in tow earned the party applause and excitement – but this was soon replaced by concern as the villagers see how old and melancholy Jahia looks.

## Battle PlansPello greeted the party and asked them to join him in the inn to discuss plans for the defense of Frickley. Grigor and Tastra attended as well. Naturally, everyone looked to Jahia for her advice. 

- She explained, however, that she is a warrior rather than a tactician, and offered only a conventional plan
	- create some pit traps to soften up Bonecruncher, have the hunters in a secure position raining arrows upon him, then have her and the party engage him in melee.
	- She despondently predicted that she might be able to last “20 or 30 seconds” against the hill giant.

Pello related that on his first visit, Bonecruncher approached the village from the south, crossing over a large fallow area known as Windmill Field. He left across the same field, so Pello was confident he would come that way again. Windmill Field is several hundred feet long and wide, with trees on either side and some low hillocks marking the southern boundary. There is also an old windmill in the field.

General idea of trapping Windmill Field.

- Grigor volunteered his farmers to aid in those preparations - they were not soldiers and would not fight the hill giant directly
	- two pit traps would be dug with 'bait', and lastly a tripwire trap where the fields were closest to town
	- coordinated attack with hunters and mounted adventurers at tripwire, hit and run to town.
- Salisha would lead one team of hunters, while Tastra led the second.
- Jahia, Bodalf, and Vezoth would be hit and run team
- Everyone then falls back to town gates
	- hunters teams will go behind walls to provide fire support from the walls
	- leave the wagons around for cover to be used by Kylantha and Rantigan for harassing spells, arrows
	- Jahia, Bodalf, and Vezoth will engage the hill giant.
- Josina Springtide has been able to assemble six potions of healing for the defenders (Evenly divided amongst Jahia, Bodalf, and Vezoth)

## The Battle of Frickley

True to expecations, shortly before noon the hill giant appeared over the low hillocks to the south, and began plodding toward the village over Windmill Field. Bonecruncher was a gross figure, towering to the height of a tree but as wide as a cart. Rolls of fat hung over a filthy loincloth and crusted blood rimmed his crooked grin. In one hand he carried an uprooted sapling, while the other held a vast brown sack dotted with various unwholesome stains. Jahia will stared grimly at the hill giant and muttered, “It is a good day to die.”The pit traps worked as hoped (24hp), infuriating the hill giant. The mounted team taunted and challenged the hill giant from the tripwire and he charged, falling prone when he hit the wire.

- hunters volley (21hp) then retreat to town
- mounted team hit (23hp) and ride to gate

Badly wounded and very angry the hill giant pursued.

### Round 1

- Jahia struck the giant for 12 hp
- Salisha and hunters assumed their positions on the wall
- From his hidden location, Rantigan fired his bow (critical hit sneak attack: 19 dmg)
- Vezoth cast *bless* on himself, Jahia, and Bodalf
- Hill giant struck Jahia for 18 hp
- Entering a rage, Bodalf struck the hill giant for 9hp
- Kylantha's magic missiles struck the hill giant for 12hp

### Round 2

- Jahia struck the killing blow on the giant

Inside the hill giant's sack was

- 4 large loaves of moldy bread
- a riding saddle of good quality 
- mangy fur pelt of a crag cat


## Conclusion

Great celebration! Jahia agreed to stay in Frickley, finally accepting a place in the community she left so long ago.

- Pello gave the group their reward
- Ithro gave Salisha a letter of recommendation to present to Daratha Shendrel of Triboar, who always needs reliable adventurers
- Jahia gave her giantslayer medallion to the party
	- She tells the group of Urgala Meltimer and Ghelryn Foehammer in Triboar as reliable
-  Nilril told Kylantha that the debt had been repaid, but if she wished to travel on to Triboar, he would send a missive to Leomenor that his task requires Kylantha to travel onward.
	-  she took him up on his offer
